    "\n",
    "1.  **Loads** the WikiGraphs dataset.\n",
    "2.  **Selects** a sample text and its corresponding ground truth graph.\n",
    "3.  **Generates** a knowledge graph using a **default system prompt**.\n",
    "4.  **Generates** a second knowledge graph using a **user-supplied system prompt** for comparison.\n",
    "5.  **Compares** the two generated graphs quantitatively (number of nodes and edges).\n",
    "6.  **Evaluates** the performance of both prompts against the ground truth graph using Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for entity linking and relation extraction."
